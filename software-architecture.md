# Software Architecture
* An architecture is a dcomposition of a system into smaller elements , interface  & rules( for further design or implementation) and the specification of the interaction between the elements & behaviors.
* The primary purpose of architecture is to support the life cycle of the system. Good architecture makes the system easy to understand, easy to develop, easy to maintain, and easy to deploy. The ultimate goal is to minimize the lifetime cost of the system and to maximize programmer productivity
